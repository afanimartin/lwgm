          <h4 class="faqs-title">Role of women in ministry</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="block-faqs-bg">
          <p class="faqs-paragraph">
            In Pentecostal churches, the role of women in ministry is influenced
            by their interpretation of biblical teachings. Pentecostal churches
            generally emphasize the importance of spiritual gifts, including
            preaching and teaching, being available to all believers, regardless
            of gender. Many Pentecostal churches allow women to actively
            participate in ministry, including preaching, teaching, leading
            worship, and serving in various leadership roles. They base this on
            passages such as Acts 2:17-18, which speaks of the Holy Spirit being
            poured out on both men and women, and Galatians 3:28, which
            highlights the equality of all believers in Christ. However, it's
            important to note that practices and beliefs can vary among
            individual Pentecostal churches and denominations. Some may have
            more traditional or complementarian views, while others may have
            more egalitarian views. It would be best to consult the specific
            teachings and leadership of the Pentecostal church you are
            interested in for their stance on the role of women in ministry.

            Should i be born again so that I will enter the kingdom of God?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="block-faqs-bg">
          <p class="faqs-paragraph">
            According to Christian doctrine, being "born again" refers to a
            spiritual rebirth and is considered necessary for entering the
            Kingdom of God. Jesus himself said in John 3:3, "Truly, truly, I say
            to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
            This means that accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior and
            receiving Him into your life is essential for salvation and eternal
            life. It involves a personal decision to turn away from sin and
            surrender your life to Jesus, allowing Him to transform and renew

            Luke 17:20–21 “Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the
            kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, “The kingdom
            of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, ‘See
            here!’ or ‘See there!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is within
            you.”

          <br />
          <p class="faqs-paragraph">
            1 Corinthians 3:16 “Do you not know that you are the temple of God
            and that the Spirit of God dwells in you”? The kingdom of God lives
            within us when we choose to follow Jesus. His spirit dwells inside
            us. God would love to live inside all of us. He will not force that
            on us though. We have to make that decision by believing Christ. I
            mean, really believing him and everything that he taught in the four
            gospels. If we do that, we will be part of his spiritual kingdom.

            What is the Holy Spirit baptism according to the penticostal
            churches?

        <div class="block-faqs-bg">
          <p class="faqs-paragraph">
            The Holy Spirit baptism, according to Pentecostal churches, is the
            experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit after accepting
            Jesus as one's Savior. It is believed to be a separate and distinct
            experience from salvation and is often characterized by speaking in
            tongues, or glossolalia. This baptism is seen as a gift from God
            that empowers believers for spiritual growth, service, and
            witnessing. It is believed that the Holy Spirit fills and empowers
            believers with spiritual gifts, such as prophecy, healing, and other
            manifestations of the Spirit's presence.
